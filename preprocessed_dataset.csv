1. The covers are not connected to the pickups and, the adjustment springs support the covers. So, you need to glue the covers on so the weight of the pickup doesn't pull loose and fall into the cavity over time. I used clear epoxy and, hoping for the best since I sold the bass when it was finished. On a positive note, the screws and springs were included which was very nice.
2. The covers have sharper corners than standard precision bass pickups so, if you use a template to route cavities,  you'll probably have to go back and chisel the corners like I did.
Im not a fan of that since it doesn't look as professional but, I was using a chrome pickup cover so, it worked out.

I use a DW 3000 Double-Pedal, and have had issues with the slave pedal sliding forward - even though it comes with it's own built-in spurs.

I tried adding additional Velcro, but that didn't stop it.  But now, with the Pearl Pedal Stabilizer on the front of it, it stays put.

That guy was 100% correct! I just popped out the existing mounting ring with a flat blade and my V67G slipped right in and could be tighly secured using the black mounting ring supplied with the V67G.

I had read a lot of negative reviews about the MXL shockmount for this microphone so I didn't want that one.  This shockmount bears a striking resemblance to the MXL 890 shockmount that came standard with my 890 vocal mic and with the same quality of construction.  The price is definitely more than fair for what you get here!

So... If you have an MXL V67G order with confidence!  I would say that this would be a much better choice than the MXL alternative.

I found a way to make the iKlip super useful. When detached from my instrument stand, the clamp assembly serves as a highly stable, adjustable kick stand.

Mounted on a mic or guitar stand, It is quite adjustable, and a channel in the socket adjustment lets the arm point all the way to the floor.

The clip holds the iPad so snugly that I would trust it in portrait mode even though the clips would be holding your device from the sides.

Overall, an excellent product. I just wish that the claws were less shallow so that I could include my book-type case. But since it does accept a thin shell, and its still portable around my house with the kickstand solution, Im satisfied.

One thing to note, per the product description:
""High Quality Multi color foam for ball shape microphones.""

Somehow I missed that line before purchasing. These will fit nicely on an SM-58 or other handheld mic with a ball-type grill. They will slide right off an SM-57 or similar shaped mic. That's not a defect, just something you want to know. But at ~$2.00 for a five-pack, I have zero complaints.

And they WILL work on a straight shaped mic with the aid of a hair-tie, rubber band, gaff tape, etc. For size reference, see pic. I have the blue one on an SM-57. I even managed to get the yellow one to stretch over a Sennheiser e609 (this is of questionable usefulness, since it's pretty much exclusively an instrumental mic, but I figured I'd see if I could).

The sounds of the 2 pedals are very similar, but the OD808 is a little smaller, has a normal stompswitch, and costs a little less than the TS808 Reissue.

Theres a ton of great zipper pockets, the handles are great and the padding is pretty decent. I use this for light traveling for my cheaper guitars. In my opinion I would not put an expensive guitar in here as the padding isn't the best, but it will still resist scratches and small bangs but more than likely not drops.
If you have an expensive Fender or anything you cherish in your collection, Id go for a strong solid case. This gig bag is mostly for around the house storage or for cheaper guitars that you wouldnt care too much if it dropped and got damaged.

Overall Im very happy with this guitar gig bag and will definitely order another one, Plus the price is too hard to pass up on.

The only gripe I have is that the fret position markers (dots) are really dark and hard to spot (see pictures). But that's not a deal breaker by any means, since when playing you would normally look at the markers on the side of the neck, which were pretty clear. Still, aesthetically the dark markers don't look as nice.

I bought mine separately) It is one heavy duty mic stand, but I got it for holding up the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield and the damn shield was too heavy to hold in place!  It kept falling over. This mic stand was sold to hold the darn thing but it only works if you place the Isolation Shield in a certain direction (see picture). You must remove the rubber pads that are on the Microphone shield, if you don't you'll find your Isolation shield on the floor! The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place. You have to constantly check the tightening supports to make sure they don't pull the support stand down with it! You also have to remove the bottom metal desk supports from the Mic Shield to lighten the load on the Mic Stand.

Tips for wah success:
- rock pedal all of the way forward
- match the volume knob to your Bass
- crank the ""Q""
- love life!

Seriously, the range this pedal hits when the ""Q"" is amazing. I love how expressive the tone is when you get it going! I think it retains the low end and adds a creamy wah in the highs and mids. Don't listen to nay-sayers that claim you lose lows!

I've been through about 4 of these in the last 3 years at my church, with two keyboard players using them each week on two separate instruments.  Each of the two keyboards/sustain pedals get used once per week, for about 20 minutes.  I don't think this is enough use to break so consistently.

It's worked great, fits underneath my Holeyboard's top shelf. It also gives me quiet clean power and no worries. I'm powering pretty standard stuff with the TC Electronic's Alter Ego included. The one thing this power supply did do for me is that I have a T-Rex Tone Bug Reverb pedal for my practice amp and it used to be noisy as could be with the OneSpot but when I switched it over to the Donner, it is much quieter.

All in all, it does what it says, works well and looks pretty cool with the blue LEDs. The actual device is hidden in the picture under the shelf but you can see the LED's glow.
